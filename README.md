I created this project using HTML, Bootstrap and Javascript within the scope of Turkcell GYGY 3.0 program.
In this project called "Skoob" you can add and edit books dynamically. You can search for books as you wish and sort them in any order you want. 
You can use it as an online library.

The real codes are here: https://github.com/waroi/TurkcellFrontend2024/tree/main/Ogrenciler/NecatiDogrul/Odevler/Vize%20-%202
